          I'm part of the Photography Club at Northwestern, and this past February,
          we took a trip to Wicker Park in Chicago to have a photoshoot. It was my
          first time exploring the surburbs outside of Evanston, and I had a blast!

          We had a total of 5 people come that day. We got to see really cool
          murals as well as take shots from many different angles. I hope to go
          visit other cool surburbs around Chicago next year!
