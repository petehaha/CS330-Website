        Hi! My name is Peter Ha. I'm a current freshman at Northwestern University.
        I was born in Oklahoma and I have three older sisters. I'm planning on
        majoring in Computer Science and am also pursing a minor in Data Science
        and a business certificate in Managerial Analytics from the Kellogg
        School of Business. This summer, I'm interning at a company called Babel
        Analytics that specializes in Machine Learning and Data Analytics for eye
        funduses. I'm not very familiar with optometry related things, but I'm
        really passionate about Machine Learning and I think it's really
        fascinating.
